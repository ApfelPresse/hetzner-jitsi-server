## Requirements
* Domain (e.g. your.domain.com)
* Account at https://console.hetzner.cloud/[Hetzner]

## Install
1. https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli[Install Terraform]
2. Create an Hetzner API Token
   -    **Sign in** into the https://console.hetzner.cloud/[Hetzner Cloud Console] choose a Project, go to **Access** → **Tokens**, and create a new token.
   - Make sure to copy the token because it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a Project, to interact with the API of another Project you have to create a new token inside the Project.
    
3. Clone this repository

         git clone https://github.com/ApfelPresse/hetzner-jitsi-server.git
         cd hetzner-jitsi-server
   
4.  Initialize Terraform
    
         terraform init

5.  Open main.tf and edit
- HETZNER_API_TOKEN
- LETSENCRYPT_DOMAIN
- LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL

6. After deploying the jitsi server you habe to point your domain to your server with an A Record.
**If you're not familiar with this try to create an A Record first (Step 8)** because you have only 1-2 Minutes after Step 7 to do this.

7. Deploy the Jitsi Server
   
         terraform apply -auto-approve

   Example Output:
   ipv4_address = "122.136.122.26"


8. Setup an A Record for your domain
- Each Domain Provider looks different, I can only give you a high level description
- Go to your Domain Provider and click on your domain
- click on *Manage DNS*
- Add a new Record
- Click on *A Record*
- Enter the IP (*ipv4_address* from step 7) in the value field

9. Now wait and after a couple of Minutes, happy Jitsiing
